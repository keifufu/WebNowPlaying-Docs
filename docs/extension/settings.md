# Settings

The settings panel is accessible by clicking on the extension icon in your toolbar or the extension overflow menu.

## Home page

This is a list of all available adapters.  
Toggling the checkbox on the left of them will enable or disable them.  
Hovering over them will reveal more options, such as temporarily disconnecting them or for custom adapters, removing them.

## Sanitization

Accessible via the settings button in the top right corner.  
Here you can toggle optional sanitization settings.

## Supported Sites

Accessible via the settings button in the top right corner.  
This is a list of all supported sites and allows toggling them on or off.  
Certain sites like YouTube also have a settings icon next to them, clicking it reveals more settings about the site.

## Unsupported Sites

Accessible via the settings button in the top right corner.  
"Unsupported Sites" are sites that don't have explicit support like ones from the previous tab.  
Enabling these isn't guaranteed to work, but it usually does a good job.

You can either enable it for all websites or set a allow/deny list.

## Desktop Players

Toggle whether adapters should use [Desktop Players](/desktop-players).
