# Settings

The settings panel is accessible by clicking on the extension icon in your toolbar or the extension overflow menu.

## Adapters

The Adapters tab shows a list of all available adapters.  
Toggling the checkbox on the left will enable or disable them.

At the bottom, there is a checkbox for "Use Native APIs", which refers to [Desktop Players](/desktop-players)

## Supported Sites

The Supported Sites tab lists all available supported sites and allows toggling them on or off.  
Certain sites like YouTube also have a settings icon next to them, clicking it reveals more settings about the site.

## Unsupported Sites

"Unsupported Sites" are sites that don't have explicit support like ones from the previous tab.  
Enabling these isn't guaranteed to work, but it usually does a good job.

You can either enable it for all websites or set a allow/deny list.

## Report Issues

Here you can directly send a report or enable automatic error reporting.
