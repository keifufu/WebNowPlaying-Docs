# Quickstart

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">

**Note**: This page assumes you are using Rainmeter, as it's the most popular option.

</div>

## Install the browser extension

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webnowplaying/jfakgfcdgpghbbefmdfjkbdlibjgnbli)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webnowplaying)

## Install the Rainmeter plugin

Download and install the latest WebNowPlaying plugin for Rainmeter

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/keifufu/WebNowPlaying-Rainmeter/releases/latest)

## Install a compatible skin

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">

The WebNowPlaying Plugin comes bundled with an example skin you can use to test if it works.

</div>

If a skin already supports WebNowPlaying, it will work out of the box. You're done!

If it uses NowPlaying, WindowsNowPlaying, MediaPlayer or the outdated Spotify plugin, you have the following options:

- Use [NoNP](https://github.com/reisir/nonp), which will automagically replace them with WebNowPlaying
- Modify the skin yourself!

## Troubleshooting

If something is still not working, read the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) guide.
