# Rainmeter Plugin

## Installing

Download and install the latest WebNowPlaying plugin for Rainmeter

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/keifufu/WebNowPlaying-Rainmeter/releases/latest)

Or with [MonD](https://github.com/meters-on-demand/cli):  
`mond install keifufu/WebNowPlaying-Rainmeter`

## Install a compatible skin

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">

The WebNowPlaying Plugin comes bundled with an example skin you can use to test if it works.

</div>

If a skin already supports WebNowPlaying, it will work out of the box. You're done!

If it uses NowPlaying, WindowsNowPlaying, MediaPlayer or the outdated Spotify plugin, you have the following options:

- Use [NoNP](https://github.com/reisir/nonp), which will automagically replace them with WebNowPlaying
- Modify the skin yourself!
