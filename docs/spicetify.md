Spicetify is a modification for Spotify Desktop that was previously used to connect WebNowPlaying with Spotify Desktop.

With version 2.0.0 and newer, WebNowPlaying can directly interact with Spotify Desktop, and **Spicetify is no longer needed**.

If you were instructed to install Spicetify for WebNowPlaying and you are using v2.0.0 or a newer version, please uninstall Spicetify and update your WebNowPlaying plugin.

Ideally, use Spotify's website instead of their desktop app for the best experience.
